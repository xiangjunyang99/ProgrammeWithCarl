2. First Thought: Because I have seen this problem many times, and both AC it using Python and C++, so this basic Binary Search problem is familiar to me. But there still many aspects I should pay attention to, like the boundary definition, the while loop condition and the middle value processing. Besides, there are several [transformation about Binary Search](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b-q6elOuztvDvUG-1qprzL-tGCAPLVqP), like 2D Binary Search, find the closest element to the target number, find the first/last occurrence of the target number.
