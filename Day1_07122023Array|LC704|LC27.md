## Array Basics [ArrayTheoryArticle](https://www.programmercarl.com/%E6%95%B0%E7%BB%84%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80.html)
- Array is a data set of same type that stored in continuous memory, it contains the data value, the index(from 0) and the memory address. If we want to add/delete an element we have to move other elements together.

- In C++, vector is built on array, so strictly speaking vector is one kind of container rather than array.
- We can not delete array, we can just do overlapping.
- 2D array, the first position is the row index(also from 0), the second position is the column index.


## LeetCode704 Binary Search
#### 1 [LeetCode704](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/) [LC704Article](https://www.programmercarl.com/0704.%E4%BA%8C%E5%88%86%E6%9F%A5%E6%89%BE.html) [LC704Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fA4y1o715/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)

#### 2 First Thought
Because I have seen this problem many times, and both AC it using Python and C++, so this basic Binary Search problem is familiar to me. But there still many details I should pay attention to, like the range definition, the while loop condition and the middle value & boundary processing. Besides, there are several [transformation about Binary Search](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b-q6elOuztvDvUG-1qprzL-tGCAPLVqP), like 2D Binary Search, find the closest element to the target number, find the first/last occurrence of the target number.

#### 3 Second Thought 
- Binary Search typically includes sorted array and no repeated elements. Once there are repeated elements maybe the requirement is first/last occurrence of target number.
- Loop Invariant Rule: here in Binary Search, the loop invariant is range definition.
- There are two ways defining the range, left&right inclusive, and left inclusive right exclusive. Once the range is defined the while loop condition and boundary processing is fixed.
- There are many details.
  - The range definition is the index(from 0), we also take use of array length.
  - while loop condition is the condition that whenever met the while loop can perform.
  - Difinition of the middle index. There are many ways to take the middle value, like mid = (left+right)//2 (round down division ); left+(right-left)//2; and bitwise method: mid = left +((right-left)>>1).
  - if statement: if elif else
  - if find the target number return the corresponding index otherwise return -1 out of the while loop.
