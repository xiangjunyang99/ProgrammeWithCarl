#### 2 First Thought
Take the squares of each element and sort them into a new array.

#### 3 Second Thought
After learning the two pointers method, using it. There are two pointers both at the left and right of the array. Because the array is non-decreasing, so the largest square number must exists at either side. We use the two pointers and calculate their corresponding squares and compare. After comparing we put the larger number squares into the newly-built array in reverse order. Repeat the iterations until the two pointers encounter in the middle. Return the new array.

#### 4 Difficulties
Implement the two pointer method but in a new question. 
And there are many details that we should pat attention to, like the larger number appears at either boundary, the order we build a new array is to put the larger number in reverse order.
And the definition of creating a known-length array in Python. 

#### 5 Gains and Time
The code is not that complicated, but the whole logic the two pointers method deserve much more understanding.


## LeetCode209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum

#### 2 First Thought
No thought. lol

#### 3 Second Thought
It combines two pointers and sliding window. Add up the elements until it meets the sum requirement, then update the minimal size. Moving the left side and subtract it from the sum to test whether the sum is larger or equal to the target. If larger, keep subtracting, if not return the minimal size.

#### 4 Difficulties
Learning the sliding window method. It's kind of like the sliding window in finance, though simpler just return the minimal size of a subarray. But in essence both are sliding window. 

#### 5 Gains and Time
Learn a new method called sliding with and apply it together with two pointer in programming.

## LeetCode59 Spiral Matrix II

#### 2 First Thought
No thought, but remember me with some 2D matrix knowledge.

#### 3 Second Thought
Loop Invariant Rule. In programming, we have to make sure in loop there is invariant which ensures the codes comply the consistent rule. In LC704 the invariant is the boundary definition. Here the invariant is the boundary as well, especially the way we deal with each matrix side. And the outer structure is vanilla nested for loop.
And a small detail is the different dealing way for odd and even matrix, as there is middle value in odd matrix. 

#### 4 Difficulties
Find the invariant in the loop. Deal with boundary of each side. And how to construct the spiral structure.

#### 5 Gains and Time
Learn about the spiral structure. Practice the Loop Invariant Rule again. This problem is a liitle bit time-consuming and confusing, as the four side how to define the boundaries every time. Which boundary should be fixed and which is to be in the for loop.
